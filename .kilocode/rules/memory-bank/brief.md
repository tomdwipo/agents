This project, "3_crew," is a monorepo containing a collection of specialized, multi-agent AI systems built with the crewAI framework. Each subdirectory within `3_crew` is a self-contained crew designed to automate a specific, complex task, such as content creation, financial research, stock analysis, and code generation. The project serves as a powerful demonstration of how specialized AI agents can be organized and orchestrated to create a 'workforce' of autonomous systems.

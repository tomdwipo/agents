# Product

## Why this project exists
- To provide a collection of specialized, pre-built AI crews that can be used to automate a variety of complex tasks.
- To serve as a demonstration and a starting point for developers who want to build their own multi-agent AI systems with crewAI.

## Problems it solves
- The complexity of building multi-agent AI systems from scratch.
- The need for ready-to-use solutions for common automation tasks like content creation, research, and coding.

## How it works
- The project is a monorepo containing multiple, independent crew projects.
- Each crew is a self-contained application with its own agents, tasks, and entry point.
- Users can run a specific crew by navigating to its directory and using the `crewai run` command.

## User experience goals
- **Ease of Use:** Each crew should be easy to run and understand, with clear instructions in its `README.md` file.
- **Customizability:** Users should be able to easily customize a crew's agents and tasks by modifying its YAML configuration files.
- **Extensibility:** The project should be easy to extend with new crews and new capabilities.

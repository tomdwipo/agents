```Thought: I need to process a list of images by adding a logo to each one. The user has provided the parameters for the logo addition. I will start with the first image in the list.

For the first image (index 1), I will call the `add_logo_to_image` tool with the following parameters:
- `base_image_path`: 'output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1.png'
- `logo_path`: 'assets/logo.png'
- `output_path`: 'output/1.png' (saving in the 'output' directory as requested)
- `position`: 'bottom-right'
- `logo_size`: (150, 120)
- `opacity`: 1.0
- `margin`: 0
Action: add_logo_to_image
Action Input: {"base_image_path": "output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1.png", "logo_path": "assets/logo.png", "output_path": "output/1.png", "position": "bottom-right", "logo_size": [150, 120], "opacity": 1.0, "margin": 0}

Thought: I need to transform the provided JSON outline into the final carousel copy. The outline contains two slides. For each slide, I will use the given title and distill the bullet points into a concise body paragraph of 25 words or less. The first slide will have a null CTA. The second slide, being the last one in the provided plan, will have a simple, educational CTA.

**Slide 1 Plan:**
- Title: "Make Your Money Work For You" (6 words - OK)
- Body: Combine the concepts of "interest on interest" and the "snowball effect". A good draft is: "Compound interest is when you earn interest on your initial money and the interest it's already earned. It's a snowball effect for your savings." (22 words - OK)
- CTA: null

**Slide 2 Plan:**
- Title: "The Power of Starting Early" (5 words - OK)
- Body: Use the provided example to illustrate the concept. A good draft is: "Invest $100 at 10% and get $110. The next year, you earn interest on the full $110. Starting early gives your money more time to grow." (25 words - OK)
- CTA: Since this is the last slide, I will add a simple call to action. "Follow for more financial tips." is appropriate.

I will now construct the final JSON object based on this plan. No external tools are needed as the source material is provided.

Thought: The search results give me several good examples:
*   Digital assistants (Siri, Alexa)
*   Navigation (Google Maps, Waze)
*   Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Spotify, shopping)
*   Smart home devices (robot vacuums)
*   Email spam filters
*   Social media feeds

I need to create a 2-slide carousel.
**Slide 1:** Hook. I'll focus on the idea that AI is already part of our daily routine.
**Slide 2:** Concrete examples. I'll pick two common examples that are easy to understand. Navigation and personalized content are great choices.

**Drafting the content:**

**Slide 1:**
*   **Title:** AI Is Already Here
*   **Bullets:**
    *   It's in your phone
    *   And in your home

This is a good hook. It's short, surprising, and directly relates to the user.

**Slide 2:**
*   **Title:** Your Daily AI Helpers
*   **Bullets:**
    *   Maps find fastest routes
    *   Playlists suggest new music

This slide provides concrete, easily recognizable examples. The bullet points are all 4 words or less. The title is 4 words.

The structure fits the requirements. Now I will format this into the final JSON output.```json
{
  "slides": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "title": "AI Is Already Here",
      "bullets": [
        "It's in your phone",
        "And in your home"
      ]
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "title": "Your Daily AI Helpers",
      "bullets": [
        "Maps find fastest routes",
        "Playlists suggest new music"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

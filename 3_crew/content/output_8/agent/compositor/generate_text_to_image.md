the final answer to the original input question
I have to add a text to the image.
I will use the `add_text_to_image` tool.
I will start with the first image.
`image_path` is `output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1.png`.
`text` is `Busy isn't productive.`.
`output_path` is `output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1_with_text.png`.
`position` is `center`.
`font_size` is 24.
`font_color` is `white`.
`font_path` is `assets/fonts/Inter.ttf`.
I'll try again.
Thought: The user wants me to add text to a series of images. I will process them one by one. I'll start with the first image.

1.  **Add text to image 1:**
    *   `image_path`: `output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1.png`
    *   `text`: `Busy isn't productive.`
    *   `output_path`: `output/posts/how-compound-interest-works/raw_images/1_with_text.png`
    *   `position`: `center`
    *   `font_size`: 24
    *   `font_color`: `white`
    *   `font_path`: `assets/fonts/Inter.ttf`

```Thought: I have successfully generated all three images in the previous steps. The next step according to the user's request is to create the final JSON list. However, my persona as "Brand Compositor" implies that I should also apply brand overlays, which includes adding the logo and text. The previous attempt to add a logo failed, likely due to a directory issue that I cannot fix.

Given the constraints and the explicit persona goal ("Apply brand overlays... and export final slides"), I should try to complete the branding steps before providing the final answer. I will attempt to add the text first to one of the generated images, and then try adding the logo again. I'll process the first slide completely, then the second, and then the third.

Let's start with the first image. I will add the body text to it. The font should be 'Inter', which I assume is available at a path like `assets/Inter-Bold.ttf`. The text should be centered and have high contrast (white on a dark background).

### Investment Decision Report

1. **Chosen Company: Chandra Daya**
   - **Market Position**: Chandra Daya had an incredibly successful IPO, which was oversubscribed 560 times. This reflects robust demand and significant investor confidence in its business model, indicating a strong position in the market.
   - **Future Outlook**: The company is strategically positioned for growth with plans to expand operations and enter new markets. Optimistic investor sentiment supports its growth trajectory.
   - **Investment Potential**: Chandra Daya stands out as a promising investment due to its ability to capture market interest and investor capital, indicating potential for substantial returns as it continues to grow.

2. **Companies Not Selected:**

   - **Fore Coffee**
     - **Reason for Not Selection**: While its IPO was also highly successful (oversubscribed 200 times), and it taps into growing consumer interest in premium coffee experiences, the scale and investor confidence demonstrated by Chandra Daya's IPO were significantly stronger.
     - **Future Outlook**: Although it has a compelling growth strategy in the food and beverage sector, the broader and more immediate market capture demonstrated by Chandra Daya gave it an edge.

   - **Trimitra Trans Persada**
     - **Reason for Not Selection**: Trimitra has a sound strategic position within the logistics sector, poised to capitalize on e-commerce growth. However, the overwhelming investor trust and broader market appeal demonstrated by Chandra Daya stood out.
     - **Future Outlook**: Although promising in terms of logistics demand, Chandra Daya's potential for capturing a larger and diversified market presence made it a more attractive choice at this time.

### Conclusion
Chandra Daya was chosen as the best investment opportunity due to its exceptional IPO success, strong investor confidence, and growth potential, leaving other viable options like Fore Coffee and Trimitra Trans Persada in lesser positions.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new crew dedicated to video generation. The crew will take a topic and a script as input, and produce a video with voiceover and background music.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature aligns with the project's vision of creating a comprehensive ecosystem of specialized AI crews by adding a new capability for video content creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate a video from a script, so that I can quickly create video content for my social media channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic and script are provided THEN the system SHALL generate a video file.
2. IF a voiceover is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a voiceover for the video.
3. WHEN background music is requested THEN the system SHALL add background music to the video.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a social media manager, I want to be able to specify the video's aspect ratio, so that I can create videos optimized for different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specific aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 9:16, 1:1) is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a video with that aspect ratio.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose.
- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable.
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules.
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers.

### Performance
- The video generation process should be completed in a reasonable amount of time.

### Security
- Any API keys used for video generation services must be stored securely.

### Reliability
- The video generation process should be reliable and produce consistent results.

### Usability
- The crew should be easy to use, with clear inputs and outputs.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new crew dedicated to video generation. The crew will take a topic as input and produce an 8-second, purely visual narrative animation using iconography to explain the concept.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature aligns with the project's vision of creating a comprehensive ecosystem of specialized AI crews by adding a new capability for video content creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Video Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate a short, conceptual video from a topic, so that I can create engaging visual content for social media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic is provided THEN the system SHALL generate an 8-second video file composed of iconography that tells a visual story related to the topic.
2. The video SHALL have a solid black (#000000) background.
3. All iconography in the video SHALL be a solid, vibrant purple (#6a45ff).
4. The video SHALL NOT contain any text, voiceover, or background music.

### Requirement 2: Aspect Ratio

**User Story:** As a social media manager, I want the video to be in a vertical format, so that it is optimized for mobile-first platforms like Instagram Reels or TikTok.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The generated video SHALL have an aspect ratio of 9:16.

### Requirement 3: Animation Details (for the topic 'Daily Improvement')

**User Story:** As a user, when I input the topic 'Daily Improvement', I want a specific visual narrative that shows the power of consistent small efforts over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **[0.0 - 1.5 seconds] The Initial State:** The video opens on a tiny, vibrant purple sapling icon on the left and a flat horizontal purple line graph on the right. The scene is static and clean.
2.  **[1.5 - 6.5 seconds] The 'Cause and Effect' Growth Phase:**
    - A sun icon cycles through its arc at the top of the frame.
    - On the first two slow cycles, a small orb of purple light detaches from the sun as it sets, is absorbed by the sapling, causing it to grow one tiny leaf. The graph ticks up by a single pixel with each cycle. A faint afterimage of the sapling's previous size is briefly visible to show the growth.
    - The animation then accelerates dramatically, with the sun cycling faster and sending a continuous stream of light into the sapling, which grows exponentially into a large tree. The graph's curve sweeps steeply upwards in sync.
3.  **[6.5 - 8.0 seconds] The Final Transformed State:**
    - All motion freezes. The sun and light stream vanish.
    - The sapling is now a large, flourishing tree icon, and the graph is a steep curve.
    - The final tree emits a single, slow, bright purple pulse that radiates outwards. The final frame holds for 1.5 seconds.
4.  **Style:** The animation must be pure iconography, with no text, a clear visual narrative, flat 2D, and modern styling.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Code Architecture and Modularity**: The crew should be built with modular and reusable components.
- **Performance**: The video generation should be completed in a reasonable timeframe.
- **Security**: API keys for any external services must be handled securely.
- **Reliability**: The generation process should be consistent and repeatable.
- **Usability**: The crew should be simple to run with clear inputs.

All iconography is a solid, vibrant purple (#6a45ff). The animation explains the concept of daily improvement without using any text.\n\n**[0.0 - 1.5 seconds]: The Initial State**\n- The video opens on the initial state: a tiny, vibrant purple sapling icon on the left and a flat horizontal purple line graph on the right. The scene holds steady and clean.\n\n**[1.5 - 6.5 seconds]: The \"Cause and Effect\" Growth Phase**\n- The animation begins. At the top of the frame, a sun icon cycles through its arc.\n- On the first slow cycle, as the sun sets, a small orb of purple light detaches from it, travels down, and is absorbed by the sapling. The sapling grows by one tiny leaf. The graph ticks up by a single pixel.\n- This repeats for a second cycle, showing the direct cause and effect: each \"day\" (sun cycle) directly \"feeds\" the growth. For a split second, a faint, ghosted afterimage of the sapling's previous size is visible, creating a direct visual comparison of \"today vs. yesterday.\"\n- Then, the animation accelerates dramatically. The sun cycles faster, sending a continuous stream of light into the icon.\n- The sapling undergoes a powerful, fluid transformation, growing exponentially into a large tree. The graph's curve sweeps steeply upwards in sync with this explosive growth.\n\n**[6.5 - 8.0 seconds]: The Final Transformed State**\n- All motion abruptly freezes. The sun and the stream of light vanish.\n- The sapling is now a large, flourishing, complex purple tree icon. The graph is a dramatic, steep curve, showing the immense change from its starting point.\n- The final tree emits a single, slow, bright purple pulse that radiates outwards, signifying its new, powerful state. The final frame holds steady for 1.5 seconds.\n\n**Style:** Pure iconography, no text, a clear visual narrative, cause-and-effect animation, flat 2D, modern, solid vibrant purple (#6a45ff) on a solid black (#000000) background.\n\n\n\nuse that format for prompt to model veo-2.0-generate-001\n\nSpecific Text Comments:\n1. \"16:9, 9:16, 1:1\": aspect ratio only 9:16\n",
